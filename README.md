# ARelearn
Build environments with a high level of involvement and interactivity, in which students can construct, design, alter, experiment, and become much more actively involved in the learning process
The approach involves superimposing sensory enhancements such as images or audio over what you actually see in the physical world.
It enables students to learn through detailed graphics and immersion in the topic.
